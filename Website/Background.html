  <span>Synthesizing drugs for a particular purpose is not an easy task - drugs are specific  
        <br> to the problem they solve, as well as the involved receptors and membranes. As 
        <br> an example, to the left you see the drug <em>Remdesivir</em>, able to assist in the treatment 
        <br> of SARS-CoV-2 by blocking off viral replication - this drug is extremely specific  
        <br> in its action, it works well against coronaviruses only because of the particular 
        <br> mechanism they use to replicate and the specific nature of their genome. It would be futile
        <br> even in the face of another virus that replicates slightly differently, let alone a bacterial
        <br> or some other type of infection.</span>
	<br> <br>
  <span>What this is meant to point out, is that the concept of drugs that are able to transcend 
        <br> the boundaries of different diseases and somehow act as treatment tools to multiple 
        <br> ailments is amazing, given how specific drugs seem to be to a particular metabolic/
        <br> molecular issue. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br> </span>

  <hr style="width:43%">
  <span class="standardBodyText">Clinical Drug Multi-Functionality</span>
  <br> <br>
  <span>As noted in the previous section, drugs are incredibly specific, so the notion of drugs that treat multiple diseases sounds  
        <br> fascinating. But, we can only say that they "sound fascinating" as students who don't really know much about drugs, or
        <br> their mechanisms, or their production. Are such multi-functional drugs that treat more than one disease interesting to the
        <br> scientific community too? Or is there no real clinical specialty to such a product? </span>
  <br> <br>
  <span>We seek to answer this by obtaining data about how many diseases each drug belonging to a general class of diseases
        <br> can treat. We then obtain information about how many clinical trials each of these drugs has been flagged in, and  
        <br> mark the most frequently mentioned drugs with respect to clinical trials. From these two sets of info, represented
	<br> graphically, one can identify whether or not a drug that has a broader scope of use in terms of diseases is also
	<br> studied more extensively (that is, shown more interest) by the field of clinical drug testing.</span>
  <br> <br>
  <span>You can find out more about how we acquire such information on our <a href="Databases.html">databases</a> page, and you can test out this tool for a  
        <br> variety of disease clusters on our main <a href="Homepage.html">homepage</a>. </span>
